How to contribute

For any contribution you had in mind, please open a detailed issue on what you are contributing and why. This way, there can be room to have a productive discussion before any code is written. It can be discussed if the contribution is a good fit for this project, fine tune contribution goals, and more.
Feel free to drop into the 100 Automations slack to reach out to me to ask any questions.

Testing
As of right now, there are no concrete testing practices. Tests on any further development will be implemented are done using pytest. If you would like to contribute, it would be best to use jest so that the project isn't dependent on multiple testing libraries.

Submitting changes
Please fork this repository and create a Pull Request to this project from that fork (How to fork a repo). In that pull request, please include thorough tests for whatever feature you are adding. If you would just like to submit more or better tests for currently existing features, that would also be much appreciated and helpful.
Please only add one feature per pull request and have clear commit messages in them.

Coding conventions
Please add code in a similar style/fashion to how code is currently written.
Thank you for being interested in contributing.
