For any questions, please feel free to drop into the 100 Automations slack and @ mention me (@Sophia Alice) to ask any questions. If you are not a member of the Hack for LA slack you can join here https://hackforla.org/slack
For any issues and non-security related bugs that feel like they could be resolved through development, please open a detailed issue on the issue and why. This way, there can be room to have a productive discussion before any changes are made. It can be discussed if the change is a good fit for this project, fine tune goals, and more.
If you would like to contribute code in response to any issues or support related needs, see the Contributing Guide.
